Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.github.com/pst4r8">@pst4r8</a>,<br/>
I'm a computer science student for at least one year and a programmer self-student for at least two. I like to program, I like to think about how to design software, structure projects, and how to write elegant code.
</p>
<p>
Moreover, I like to study programmer languages, functional programming, clean code, and talk about Linux, open-source, and tech in general. 
</p>
<p>
I have developed personal projects in which I work with web apps, APIs, bots, and databases. I used concepts of functional programming, object-oriented programming, REST API, and image processing.
</p>
<p>
See the section about my programmer skills to see my projects and languages that I used, or contact me if you have an interest.

<p>
To work with image processing, bots, and automation I used Python. Here's one bot that I made, and a script where I use image processing to create a fractal.
</p>
<p>
To develop web apps and APIs I used JavaScript, ReactJs, and ExpressJS. Here's a library that I developed with this language.
</p>
<p>
Besides, I know and like many concepts of functional programming, where I learned from the Haskell language and javascript. See a package where I used the beauty of the Haskell type system.
</p>
<p>
See my <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/pst4r8">github account</a> to known more about these projects.
